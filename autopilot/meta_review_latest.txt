CRITICAL PHYSICS ISSUE DETECTED!
================================
BASE_B_DRAG = 0.5 (5x too high! Should be 0.1)
BASE_K_ANG_DAMP = 0.35 (75% too high! Should be 0.2)

These excessive damping values make the drone move like it's in syrup!
This is why OOB is stuck at 95% - the drone can't fly properly!

URGENT ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Edit /PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h
2. Change BASE_B_DRAG back to 0.1f
3. Change BASE_K_ANG_DAMP back to 0.2f
4. Remove any soft walls/centralizing fields
5. Rebuild bindings
