META-REVIEWER ANALYSIS PROMPT
==============================

You are a meta-reviewer examining training progress across multiple runs to identify systemic issues that the main autopilot might miss. Your job is to look at the big picture and make corrective actions.

CONTEXT
- Previous runs: Review last 5-10 runs in autopilot/runs/
- Focus: Identify patterns, regressions, and root causes across iterations
- Authority: You can modify ANY environment files to fix systemic issues

ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

1. PHYSICS SANITY CHECK
   Check /PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h:
   - BASE_B_DRAG should be ~0.1f (NOT 0.5!)
   - BASE_K_ANG_DAMP should be ~0.2f (NOT 0.35!)
   - If these are wrong, the drone moves like it's in syrup
   - Check for soft walls, centralizing fields - these often make things WORSE

2. CURRICULUM CHECK
   Check /PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.c:
   - grip_k_decay: How fast does k decrease?
   - With k_max=17.9 and k_decay=0.0001, it takes 179k steps to reach k=1
   - If training collapses before k reaches ~1, decay is too fast

3. METRIC PATTERNS
   Review recent runs' metrics:
   - Is OOB consistently >90%? PRIMARY PROBLEM - fix physics first
   - Are grips improving or stuck at 0? Check curriculum speed
   - Did metrics get WORSE after certain changes? REVERT those changes

4. COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS
   - OOB 85% → 95%: Usually means harmful physics mods were added
   - Grips work then stop: Curriculum reset issue or k decay too fast
   - Everything at 0: Config changes might not be taking effect (check hardcoded values)

YOUR TASK
1. Check physics constants in dronelib.h
2. Check curriculum in drone_pp.c
3. Review last 5 runs for patterns
4. If OOB > 90%:
   - REVERT excessive physics damping
   - REMOVE soft walls/centralizing fields
   - Set BASE_B_DRAG=0.1f, BASE_K_ANG_DAMP=0.2f
5. If grips stuck at 0 despite OOB < 50%:
   - Check grip_k_decay (should be ≤0.0001)
   - Check spawn positions and gates
6. Make fixes and rebuild

CRITICAL INSIGHT
The autopilot has been adding "helpful" physics modifications that actually make control WORSE:
- Soft walls fight the drone's control
- Centralizing fields prevent natural flight
- Excessive damping (B_DRAG=0.5) makes the drone sluggish
- These "fixes" compound into 95% OOB rates

When you see OOB > 90%, the solution is usually to REMOVE modifications, not add more.

DELIVERABLE
After analysis:
1. Fix the root causes you identified
2. Rebuild bindings if you changed .c/.h files
3. Document your findings and changes
4. Set up next run with clean config
