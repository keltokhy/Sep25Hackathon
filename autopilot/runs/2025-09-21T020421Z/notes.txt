Run 2025-09-21T020421Z — diagnostic_grip analysis and next env tweak

Problem observed (from trainer_summary + train_full log):
- perfect_grip = 0.0; perfect_deliv = 0.0
- ho_pickup ≈ 0.062; de_pickup ≈ 0.062; to_drop = 0.0; ho_drop = 0.0
- oob ≈ 0.857; collision_rate ≈ 0.0055; episode_len ≈ 148; SPS ≈ 1.66–1.70M; CPU ≈ 340%
- Failure mode: diagnostic_grip — agents rarely satisfy pickup gates; descent/grip attempts too rare; high OOB persists.

Change (for next iteration):
- File: PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h
- Pickup descent: relax XY alignment threshold from 0.20 → 0.30 · max(k, 1.0).
- Grip gates: widen thresholds from 0.20·k to 0.30·k for xy_dist, z_dist, and speed; keep vertical speed gate `vel.z > -max(0.15, 0.06·k)` and `< 0`.
- Drop descent: mirror the XY alignment relaxation (0.20 → 0.30 · max(k, 1.0)) to maintain symmetry once grips appear.

Historical alignment (Notes → Header evolution):
- Preserves phase logic (hover → descent → grip → carry → deliver) and avoids re‑introducing low‑altitude penalties.
- Builds on prior tweaks: hidden hover target usage, XY‑gated descent, gentler −0.06 m/s vertical rate, and near‑miss attempt counters.

Expected impact (hypothesis):
- Increase ho/de_pickup and env.log.attempt_grip; achieve first non‑zero grips under k≈1; modest OOB decrease from earlier descent reducing drift.
- Collision rate should remain low; deliveries may remain zero until grips register reliably.

Next run policy:
- Keep `autopilot/proposals/next_config.json` as `{}` (no hyperparameter changes); resume fresh.
