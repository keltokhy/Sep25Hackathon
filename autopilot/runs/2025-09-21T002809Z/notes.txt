Run 2025-09-21T002809Z — analysis and response

Problem
- No successful grips or deliveries (perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0).
- ho_pickup and de_pickup near-zero by end; to_drop=0 consistently.
- OOB resets high (≈0.86 early → ≈0.60 later); collisions low (~0.005–0.009).

Evidence
- trainer_summary.json: success_rate=0.0; collision_rate≈0.005; epoch=85; SPS peaked ≈1.6M.
- train.log snapshots: oob 0.86→0.60; ho_pickup≈0→low; de_pickup≈0; ho_drop≈0; perfect_* = 0.

Historical guardrails consulted
- Notes → Header Evolution: keep phased logic (hover → descend → grip → deliver) and event gates aligned with reward shaping; prefer small, testable changes.

Change (Environment only)
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h:
  • Lower initial hover offset above box from +0.8m → +0.6m to reduce descent distance and overshoot.
  • Slow Phase‑2 descent hidden velocity from −0.08 → −0.06 m/s for stability entering grip.
  • Relax Phase‑2 grip gates: xy/z/speed thresholds 0.15·k → 0.20·k; vertical velocity gate −0.08·k → −0.06·k.

Behavioral hypothesis
- diagnostic_grip: Agents reach the pickup zone but fail to stabilize and satisfy grip gates; high OOB suggests overshoot/instability near the box. Gentler descent plus a slightly wider gate should convert more hover attempts into actual grips, raising ho_pickup and de_pickup counts and enabling first deliveries, while modestly reducing OOB. Collisions expected to stay low.

Build & test
- Rebuilt native bindings: `cd PufferLib && NO_TRAIN=1 python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace --force` (success).
- Smoke import OK: `pufferlib.ocean.drone_pp.binding` imported.

Next iteration
- Keep proposals `{}` (no hparam edits). Run single iteration, then check: ho/de_pickup ↑, any non‑zero grips/deliveries, OOB trend ↓. If grips appear but drops fail, pivot to improve_carrying (mass/drag/grip decay, drop gates).
