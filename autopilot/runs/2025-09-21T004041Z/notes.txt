Problem
- Grip improved (ho/de_pickup high), but carry→drop stalled: `to_drop` stayed ~0, `ho_drop` rare, and OOB remained elevated (early ~0.82 → late ~0.37).
- Drop hover gate mismatched the target: gate required z 0.7–1.3m above drop while the commanded hover target was only +0.4m, making consistent `ho_drop` unlikely.
- `approaching_drop` was never set, obscuring approach progress in logs.

Change (environment only)
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h: align drop approach + descent
  • Set `approaching_drop = true` once gripping and aiming at the drop.
  • Align drop hover z gate with commanded hover (+0.4m): window 0.3–0.6m (was 0.7–1.3m).
  • Lower hidden drop hover to +0.6m (mirrors pickup) to reduce overshoot.
  • Make drop descent gentler: `hidden_vel.z = -0.06f` (was −0.10f).

Historical context
- Follows the 2025‑09‑21 “Grip diagnostic patch” in Notes: after gentler pickup descent and wider grip gates, next step is to stabilize carry & drop without loosening delivery gates excessively.
- Avoids re‑introducing removed behaviors (e.g., low‑altitude penalties); only aligns gates with intended targets and improves instrumentation.

Hypothesis / Expected impact
- `to_drop` and `ho_drop` counters increase (instrumentation + correct gate), indicating consistent approach to drop zone.
- First deliveries register more reliably (delivery gate unchanged), with collisions stable and OOB reduced during carry and descent.
- Overall end‑to‑end improves from 0 with a visible upward trend across next 1–2 runs if grip remains stable.

Notes
- Hparams unchanged per policy; next_config staged as {}.
- Rebuilt native bindings; smoke import OK.
