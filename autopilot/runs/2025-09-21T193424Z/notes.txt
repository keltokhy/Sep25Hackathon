Deltas:
- vs previous (2025-09-21T192339Z): oob −0.005; ho_pickup +0.009; de_pickup +0.012; to_pickup +340; perfect_grip ↔ 0; perfect_deliv ↔ 0; mean_reward +2.53; episode_length −1.19
- vs baseline (best.json → 2025-09-21T192339Z): oob +0.001; ho_pickup roughly +0.009; de_pickup roughly +0.012; others similar

Diagnosis:
- OOB remains the primary failure (>95%). Hover/descend signals emerged slightly after relaxing the pickup hover gate, but no grips/deliveries yet. Navigation still unstable enough that episodes terminate predominantly due to boundary violations before reaching (or staying at) hover.

Change staged for next run (env/drone_pp.h):
- Slow early action ramp: scale actions 0.5→1.0 over ~800k global steps (was ~400k). This reduces early saturation without adding soft walls or centralizing fields.

Expected impact:
- OOB ↓ (primary); episode_length ↑; ho_pickup/de_pickup ↗; collisions stable.

Resume policy for next run:
- autopilot.resume_mode: continue
- autopilot.resume_from: latest
- autopilot.save_strategy: best

Notes:
- Kept relaxed hover gate (dist_to_hidden 0.8; speed 0.6). Will only touch descent/grip gates if hover/descent signals improve but grips remain at 0.
- Do NOT change training hparams. EXACT_CONFIG=1 remains in effect.
