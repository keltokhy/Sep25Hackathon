Behavioral hypothesis (diagnostic_grip): Agents rarely meet grip gating and go OOB frequently. Relaxed hover/grip gates and gentler descent were insufficient; agents often fail to reach stable hover above the box.

Observed metrics
- SPS: ~1.68M; CPU ~330%; device=mps
- perfect_grip: 0.0; perfect_deliv: 0.0
- ho_pickup: ~0.03; de_pickup: ~0.03; to_drop: 0.0; ho_drop: 0.0
- oob: ~0.876; collision_rate: ~0.005; episode_length: ~128

Problem
- Hover/grip attempts are rare and OOB resets dominate early rollout phases. Long traversals from random spawns to the box likely increase drift and boundary hits before entering the hover → descend → grip sequence.

Change (next iteration)
- In `PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h::reset_pp2`, spawn each drone close to its own box (1.0–2.5 m lateral radius, 1.5–2.5 m above), clamp to grid, zero initial velocity/omega.

Historical alignment
- Follows Notes → Header Evolution themes: refine phase targeting and reduce descent overshoot without re‑introducing removed penalties. Aligned with Notes §Open Questions: consider spawn spacing tweaks when OOB remains high.

Expected effect
- Increase `to_pickup` and `ho_pickup` as agents start near the pickup location; yield first non‑zero grips (`gripping` and possibly `perfect_grip` late in ramp) without increasing collisions.
