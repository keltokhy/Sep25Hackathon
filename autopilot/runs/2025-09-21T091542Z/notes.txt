Run ID: 2025-09-21T091542Z (iteration 3)

Problem
- High OOB (0.75→0.84 across snapshots), collisions low (~2.5–3.9%).
- Early snapshots showed higher score (~82) and non‑zero perfect_grip/deliv, but metrics collapsed later (score ~17; perfect_deliv ~0.9).
- to_pickup/ho/de_pickup are high, but to_drop/ho_drop remain much lower; delivery success near zero.
- Pattern suggests carry‑phase instability and boundary exits post‑grip; curriculum already clamped to ~200k steps.

Change (environment only)
- drone_pp.h: Remove post‑grip random_bump() disturbance to avoid injecting velocity/omega right after gripping.
- drone_pp.h: Widen box/drop spawn margins (edge_margin 8→12) to reduce early boundary proximity.

Expected Impact
- OOB decreases (primary). Fewer boundary exits following grip; more stable carry to the drop zone.
- to_drop and ho_drop increase; attempt_drop increases; delivery_success begins to rise.
- Collisions stay roughly unchanged (~2–3%).

Outcome (this run)
- Baseline measurements (pre‑change): oob≈0.824–0.841; perfect_grip small but non‑zero; perfect_deliv ~0–4; to_drop modest; ho_drop low.
- Changes will take effect next iteration.

Next
- Re‑check OOB and drop‑phase metrics. If OOB still >0.80, consider further spawn tightening (r_xy) or slightly wider drop descent XY gate.
