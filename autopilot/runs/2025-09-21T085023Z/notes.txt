Run 2025-09-21T085023Z

Problem
- OOB still high (≈0.80–0.81); collisions low (~0.028). Many grips but very few deliveries.
- Final UI snapshot: perf≈0.375, score≈31.0, oob≈0.814, collision_rate≈0.028, episode_return≈-0.196.
- Phase signals: ho_pickup≈12.1k, de_pickup≈12.1k, perfect_grip≈851; to_drop≈612, ho_drop≈127; perfect_deliv≈12.6.
- Interpretation: pickup/descend/grip happening; carry reaches drop sometimes (to_drop, ho_drop > 0), but drop success gate seems too strict relative to carry noise, so deliveries rarely register.

Change (for next run)
- Env: relax drop delivery success gates in `drone_pp.h` to mirror pickup tolerance.
  • Before: success if XY < 0.35·k and Z < 0.30·k.
  • After:  success if XY < 0.40·k and Z < 0.40·k (match pickup gates).

Expected Impact
- Delivery_success↑ (convert sustained hovers near drop into deliveries).
- to_drop↑, ho_drop↑ or ↔; OOB↔/↓ (fewer prolonged carries drifting OOB post‑hover).
- Collisions remain low (~2–3%).

Outcome (this run)
- success_rate (perfect_deliv)≈12.63; mean_reward≈30.98; episode_len≈191.35; SPS≈1.87M.
- OOB improved vs earlier high‑OOB runs (e.g., 0.95→0.81) but still high; carry remains the limiting phase.

Next
- Validate delivery_success↑ and OOB↔/↓. If ho_drop increases without delivery_success improving, widen drop descent XY gate slightly or add a small bias toward holding altitude over the drop during carry jitter.
