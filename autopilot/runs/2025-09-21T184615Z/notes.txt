Deltas:
- vs previous: N/A (first iteration in this loop)
- vs baseline pointer (best/baseline): not comparable (no matching artifact files). Trend consistent with high OOB regime.

Diagnosis:
- Primary failure: OOB ≈ 96% dominates; zero hover/grip/drop signals. Root causes traced in code:
  • Spawns for box/drop and agents use full ±MARGIN bands (XY) and z≈floor (0.5 m), increasing floor hits and boundary runaways.
  • Velocity penalty applies only near target (scaled by proximity), enabling far‑field runaways.
  • Boundary proximity penalty was removed, eliminating gentle discouragement near edges.
  • Curriculum uses horizon‑local tick (resets) and aggressive decay (0.02), collapsing k quickly and cyclically.
  • Observations guide toward target_pos instead of hidden hover point, making hover acquisition harder.

Change (for next run):
- Spawns: add XY edge_margin=10 m and raise box/drop z to −GRID_Z+1.5; spawn PP2 agents away from edges and above floor.
- Rewards: re‑add gentle boundary proximity penalty (start at 0.8·GRID, weight −0.15).
- Velocity shaping: switch to distance‑scaled global penalty (full near target, 10% strength far‑field).
- Observations: use hidden hover point for PP2 dx/dy/dz guidance.
- Descent: slow hidden z descent to −0.05 m/s for pickup and drop.
- Curriculum: reintroduce global_tick schedule and clamp effective grip_k decay to max (k_max−k_min)/200k.

Expected impact:
- OOB ↓ materially; episode_length ↑; ho/de_pickup → > 0; attempt_grip becomes non‑zero; collisions stable (~0.5–2%).
- No hyperparameter changes; proposals left as {} per policy.

Interactions to watch:
- Mild centralization from edge_margin; monitor exploration collapse. If ho/de improve but OOB remains high, revisit agent spawn band or add gentle early action scaling (0.7→1.0 over 100k).
