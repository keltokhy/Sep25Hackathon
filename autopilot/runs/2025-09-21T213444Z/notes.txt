Δ vs previous (2025-09-21T212447Z)
- mean_reward: +3.88 (34.03 → 37.91)
- episode_length: +73.46 (316.69 → 390.15)
- collision_rate: −2.05pp (9.45% → 7.41%)
- oob: −3.4pp (65.4% → 62.0%)
- attempts: attempt_grip rose from near-zero in prior summary to ~0.38/ep; drop attempts present → carry sometimes engages

Δ vs baseline (2025-09-21T180522Z)
- Baseline summary not available; using best.json pointer for context only.

Diagnosis
- Hover and descent phases are established (ho/de_pickup high). Near‑miss grips are frequent (attempt_grip>0), yet perfect_grip and perfect_deliv remain 0 due to strict acceptance floors at k≈1.
- OOB remains the main headroom (62%), but improving vs prior run (−3.4pp) without physics crutches.

Environment Change (for next iteration)
- Curriculum: slow k‑decay by 25× (200k → 5M global steps) to keep the easy regime longer and avoid immediate collapse to strict gates.
- Gates: relax pickup acceptance floors (XY 0.70, Z 0.60, speed 0.85, |vz|≤0.35; allow z > −0.30 and vz ≤ 0.30) to convert frequent near‑misses into occasional grips.
- Drop: relax near‑miss and success floors (near XY 0.50, Z 0.35; accept XY 0.40, Z 0.35) to register deliveries when carry succeeds.

Expected Impact (next run)
- attempt_grip↑, first non‑zero perfect_grip; to_drop/ho_drop↑ and first non‑zero deliveries possible.
- OOB ≤ 0.70 with collisions ≤ 0.10; SPS stable.

Interactions
- Systems touched: curriculum (k), gates (hover/descend/grip/drop), rewards unchanged, physics unchanged, spawn unchanged.
- Watch for: false‑positive grips at high speed; if collisions/oob spike, revisit speed/vz floors.

Autopilot Override for next run
