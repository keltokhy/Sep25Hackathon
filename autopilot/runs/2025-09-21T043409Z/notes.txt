Problem: diagnostic_grip persists with extreme OOB.
- From train.log (final panel): perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.009, de_pickup≈0.009; to_drop=0.0, ho_drop=0.0
- oob≈0.953, collision_rate≈0.005, episode_length≈50
Change (next iteration plan): add early action governor (scale actions when k>1) to curb untrained saturation and reduce OOB; no hparam changes.
Expected: OOB↓, ho/de_pickup↑; first grip attempts register (attempt_grip↑); perfect_grip may become >0.
