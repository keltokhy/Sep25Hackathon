 Run 2025-09-21T212447Z (iteration 17)

Problem
- End-to-end success remains zero; perfect_grip=0, perfect_deliv=0.
- OOB regressed to ~0.692 (vs 0.504 prior) as activity increased; collisions ~0.095.

Key Metrics (final User Stats)
- oob: 0.692; collision_rate: 0.0945; episode_length: 316.69; mean_reward: 34.03; SPS: 1.69M; epoch: 85

Deltas
- vs previous (2025-09-21T211342Z): mean_reward +5.72; ep_len −191.88; oob +0.188; collisions +0.0498; SPS −0.11M
  • Attempts/events: ho_pickup +1.97k; de_pickup +1.94k; to_drop +1.81k; ho_drop +0.30k; attempt_grip +0.367; attempt_drop +2.104
- vs baseline pointer (best.json → 2025-09-21T211342Z): same as above

Interaction Effects
- More generous hover gate + curriculum clamp produced high hover/descend and near-miss rates, but pickup acceptance still blocks grips at k≈1.
- Higher activity correlates with higher OOB and collisions, indicating exploration without conversion.

Hypothesis
- Pickup acceptance floors (XY/Z/speed/vz) remain slightly too strict at k≈1; frequent near-misses fail final gate → no grips.

Change (staged for next run)
- Relax pickup acceptance floors (env/drone_pp.h):
  • XY tol floor: 0.50 (was 0.60)
  • Z tol floor: 0.50 (was 0.55)
  • Speed tol floor: 0.70 (was 0.75)
  • |vz| tol floor: 0.30 (was 0.35)
  • Accept z > −0.25 (was −0.20); cap vz ≤ 0.25 (was 0.20)
- No changes to spawn margins, boundary proximity penalty, or curriculum clamp.

Expected Impact (next)
- First non-zero perfect_grip; to_drop/ho_drop maintain or improve; OOB ≤ 0.72; collisions ≤ 0.11.
- If grips still zero with attempt_grip high, next consider: small pickup attempt reward and/or widen vz acceptance modestly.
