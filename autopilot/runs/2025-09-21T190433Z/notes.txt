Run 2025-09-21T190433Z — Iteration 3

Problem
- OOB extremely high (0.960). No ho_pickup/de_pickup; zero grip/delivery. Score ~16.92; collisions low (~0.47%).

Observations (Δ vs 2025-09-21T185523Z / 2025-09-21T184615Z)
- oob: 0.960 (−0.002 / +0.001)
- ho_pickup: 0.000 (−0.001 / 0.000) | de_pickup: 0.000 (−0.001 / 0.000)
- perfect_grip: 0.000 (±0.000) | perfect_deliv: 0.000 (±0.000)
- to_pickup: 2598.47 (+77.78 / −70.71)
- episode_length: 42.53 (+1.21 / −1.10)
- sps: 1.53M (−0.30M / −0.28M)

Root Cause Hypothesis
- Primary failure is boundary fly-offs before reaching hover: policy saturates actions → rapid outbound drift → early resets. Hover gates aren’t reached (ho_pickup≈0). Curriculum/gates secondary until OOB improves.

Environment Changes (for next iteration)
- c_step: boundary-aware action softening near XY walls (scale actions from 1.0→0.5 between 90–100% of GRID). No external forces added.
- reset_pp2/reset_agent: increase edge margin from 10→17 to spawn drones/targets more centrally and reduce early wall interactions.

Expected Impact
- OOB: −20–30pp (target <0.75). ho_pickup: >0.005 emerging. de_pickup begins to register. Collisions unchanged.

Interaction Effects to Watch
- Potential underactuation near boundaries; ensure agents can still turn inward. Verify no regressions in SPS.

Next Step
- Run fresh with same baseline; if OOB still >0.90, extend action ramp horizon and/or slightly relax hover thresholds before touching curriculum.
