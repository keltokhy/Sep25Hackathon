Δ vs previous (2025-09-21T180522Z)
- Δ oob: -0.001

- Δ ho_drop: -0.001
- Δ episode_return: -0.006
- Δ collision_rate: -0.001

Δ vs baseline (2025-09-21T180522Z)
- Same as previous (baseline pinned)

Suspected cause
- OOB remains the primary blocker: early action saturation with full-range motor commands leads to rapid boundary exits before hover can stabilize.

Change staged for next run
- Add gentle action scaling ramp (0.7→1.0 over first ~100k global steps) applied uniformly to motor commands before integration.

Expected impact
- OOB ↓ (primary), longer episodes, ho/de_pickup ↔/↑, attempt_grip ↑. Collisions stable.

Exit criteria for this subgoal
- +5pp grip_success and +1pp delivery_success vs baseline, with OOB not worse by >2pp.
