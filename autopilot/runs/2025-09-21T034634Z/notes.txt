Run: 2025-09-21T034634Z (iteration 5)

Problem observed (behavioral_analysis fallback to train.log):
- perfect_grip = 0.000, perfect_deliv = 0.000
- ho_pickup ~ 0.015–0.035, de_pickup ~ 0.014–0.034 (very low)
- to_drop = 0.000, ho_drop = 0.000
- oob ≈ 0.874–0.888 (dominant resets), collision_rate ≈ 0.005
- episode_return ≈ -0.36, episode_length ≈ 116–131

Diagnosis:
- Diagnostic grip: drone rarely reaches hover; descent/grip never triggered.
- Fix stability: extremely high OOB suggests drift/overshoot dominates before hover gates can engage, despite relaxed gates and spawn-near-box.

Change (environment-only):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h: add soft boundary forces (F_soft) — gentle repulsion within 1.0m of XY walls and 0.8m of floor/ceiling; summed into linear acceleration. No gate/reward/hparam edits.
  • Rationale: reduce early OOB terminations so agents can stabilize and attempt hover; aligns with Notes ‘fix_stability’ and avoids re‑introducing low‑altitude penalties.
  • Dimension: physics (stability); orthogonal to prior gate tweaks.

Expected impact (next run):
- oob↓↓, episode_length↑, ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑; collisions unchanged.
- With more stable approach, first near‑grip attempts should register (attempt_grip↑), enabling first grips.
