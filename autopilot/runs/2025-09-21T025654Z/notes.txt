Run 2025-09-21T025654Z — analysis and follow‑ups

Problem observed (diagnostic_grip):
- perfect_grip = 0.000; perfect_deliv = 0.000
- to_drop = 0.000; ho_drop = 0.000 (final panel)
- OOB ≈ 0.867, collisions ≈ 0.005 (trainer_summary + train.log)
- mean_reward ≈ 6.146; episode_length ≈ 138; SPS ≈ 1.7M; epoch 85
- summary.json not generated for this run; fell back to train_full log and trainer_summary.json.

Change (environment only):
- drone_pp.h (PP2 pickup Phase‑2) relaxed grip gates and added shaping for credible attempts:
  • xy_dist_to_box < k·0.40 (was 0.30)
  • z_dist_above_box < k·0.40 & > 0.0 (was 0.30)
  • speed < max(0.8, k·0.40) (was k·0.30)
  • vz gate: > −max(0.20, 0.08·k) and < 0.0 (was −max(0.15, 0.06·k))
  • near‑miss window now adds a small shaping bonus: reward += reward_hover·0.25 when attempt_grip increments.

Expected impact (hypothesis):
- Convert more descent interactions into actual grips without raising collisions.
- attempt_grip↑, ho/de_pickup↑, first non‑zero grips, and to_drop > 0 next run.
- OOB should not increase materially; XY‑gated descent remains in place.

Historical alignment:
- Respects the recent shift toward hidden‑hover guidance and XY‑gated descent (see Notes.md “Header Evolution”).
- Continues diagnostic_grip line of inquiry; does not re‑introduce the removed low‑altitude penalty.

Next:
- Keep config baseline unchanged (no hparam changes). Prepare fresh run with these env tweaks.
