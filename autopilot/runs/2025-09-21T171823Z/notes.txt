Run 2025-09-21T171823Z — iteration 1

Problem
- OOB extremely high (≈0.921 final snapshot). perfect_grip=0, perfect_deliv=0; collisions≈0.058; episode_len≈82.9; SPS≈2.0M.
- ho/de_pickup counters high but no conversions to grips → carry → drop.

Root cause
- Regression after making the XY boundary proximity penalty earlier/stronger (start at 55% of GRID, weight −0.25). Over‑penalized wide exploration and degraded stability, increasing boundary exits before hover/grip could stabilize.

Change (staged for NEXT run)
- Revert boundary proximity shaping in compute_reward (drone_pp.h): start at 80% of GRID and weight −0.15 (gentler).
- No hyperparameter changes; spawn/physics/curriculum unchanged.

Expected impact
- Primary: OOB↓; episode_len↑.
- Diagnostic_grip: ho/de_pickup ↔/↑; first non‑zero grips; to_drop/ho_drop↑.
- Stability: collisions remain ≈2–3%.

Observations (final UI snapshot)
- perf≈0.150, score≈−2.257, oob≈0.921, collision_rate≈0.058, episode_length≈82.901
- perfect_grip=0.000, perfect_deliv=0.000, to_pickup≈5186, ho_pickup≈4975, de_pickup≈4916, to_drop≈40, ho_drop≈0.47, attempt_grip≈0.947, attempt_drop=0.000
