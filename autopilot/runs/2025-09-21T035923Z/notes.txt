Run: 2025-09-21T035923Z (iteration 6)

Problem observed (from train log + trainer_summary):
- perfect_grip = 0.000; perfect_deliv = 0.000; end_to_end_success = 0.000
- ho_pickup ≈ 0.004→0.010 (very low); de_pickup ≈ 0.004→0.010
- to_drop = 0.000; ho_drop = 0.000 → no carrying
- oob ≈ 0.953 (extremely high); collision_rate ≈ 0.0048; episode_length ≈ 50
- SPS ≈ 1.38M; Epoch 85; CPU ≈ 340%

Diagnosis:
- diagnostic_grip with severe stability issue. Despite prior damping and soft boundaries, agents reset OOB rapidly, preventing hover/descent.

Change (environment-only, physics/stability):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h:
  • Increase BASE_B_DRAG: 0.20 → 0.35 (reduce XY drift/overshoot)
  • Strengthen soft-boundary forces and widen bands: wall_band 1.0→2.0, wall_k 2.0→12.0; floor_band 0.8→1.2, floor_k 8.0→12.0; ceil_band 0.8→1.2, ceil_k 4.0→8.0.
  Rationale: Reduce early OOB terminations so policies can stabilize above the box and attempt descent → grips.
  Dimension: physics (stability), consistent with Notes ‘fix_stability’; minimal, no reward/gate/hparam edits.

Expected impact (next run):
- oob↓↓, episode_length↑, ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑; collisions stable.
- With longer stable windows near box, attempt_grip↑; first non‑zero grips possible; to_drop begins.

Overrides for next run:
- autopilot/proposals/next_config.json = {} (no hyperparameter changes). Resume fresh; save_strategy=best.
