Run 2025-09-21T062450Z — iteration 5

Problem
- OOB extremely high (~0.952). Collisions ~0.022. Episode length ~51.2.
- perfect_grip ~0.10, perfect_deliv 0.00. to_drop ~1.73k; ho_drop ~36; attempt_drop ~0.002.
- ho_pickup and de_pickup strong, but chains rarely convert to delivery; high OOB dominates.

Root cause hypothesis
- Excessive translational/rotational speeds allow random drift to hit boundaries and floor quickly.
- With BASE_MAX_VEL=50 m/s and BASE_MAX_OMEGA=50 rad/s, early/random actions induce large displacements before reward shaping can stabilize hover.
- Spawn is near box, but boxes can still be within ~3m of hard boundaries, leaving little margin with high speeds.

Change (environment-only)
- dronelib.h: reduce clamps to curb drift and spin
  • BASE_MAX_VEL: 50.0 → 20.0 m/s
  • BASE_MAX_OMEGA: 50.0 → 25.0 rad/s
- drone_pp.h reset_pp2: increase edge margin for box/drop spawns
  • edge_margin: 3.0 → 6.0 (spawn further from walls)

Expected impact
- OOB ↓ significantly (primary). Longer episodes, more stable hover around pickup/drop.
- ho_pickup/de_pickup remain high or improve; attempt_grip ↑ and better conversion to grips.
- perfect_grip may tick up; deliveries may begin to register once OOB is controlled.
- Collisions should remain ~2.2%.

Next
- If OOB remains >0.90, further reduce BASE_MAX_VEL to 15 or tighten XY descent gating slightly.
- If OOB improves and grips rise but deliveries remain 0, revisit drop hover/descent gates (already relaxed); consider slight increase to drop success z-window.
