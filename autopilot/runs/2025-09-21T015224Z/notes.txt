Profile: baseline_full (EXACT_CONFIG=1); device=mps; vec 24/24; env 24×64

Problem observed (diagnostic_grip):
- perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0; to_drop=0.0, ho_drop=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.136, de_pickup≈0.135 → approach/hover/descent occur but do not convert to grips
- oob≈0.835 (high), collision_rate≈0.0058, episode_len≈170; SPS≈1.70M; CPU≈333%

Change (for next iteration):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h → Pickup Phase‑2 grip gate: relax vertical descent condition from `vel.z > -0.06·k` to `vel.z > -max(0.15, 0.06·k)` (and `< 0`).
- Rationale: At k≈1 the −0.06 m/s cap is too strict; agents descend slightly faster and miss the gate, yielding zero grips. Allowing moderate descent should register legitimate grips without encouraging crashes.
- Historical context: aligns with Notes §4 (“Relax pickup hover gate further”) and extends gating per Decisions Log by targeting vertical speed specifically. Does not re‑introduce previously removed low‑altitude penalties.

Expected impact:
- ho/de_pickup↑, attempt_grip↑; first non‑zero grips and `to_drop > 0`.
- OOB should not increase due to XY‑alignment gating and gentle hidden descent (−0.06 m/s) remaining in place.

Next:
- Keep proposals `{}` (no hparam changes). Resume fresh. Monitor attempt_grip, gripping, to_drop/ho_drop, and OOB.
