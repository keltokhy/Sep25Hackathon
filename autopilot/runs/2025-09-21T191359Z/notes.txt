Deltas
- vs previous (2025-09-21T190433Z): oob +0.001; mean_reward −0.46; ep_len −0.13; collisions +0.00007; no change in grip/deliv (still 0).
- vs baseline (best pointer 2025-09-21T190433Z): same as above (no improvement).

Diagnosis
- Primary failure remains extreme OOB (~96%). No hover or descent attempts registered; grip and delivery remain zero. Recent boundary-aware action softening and stronger centralization did not reduce OOB.

Change Implemented (for next run)
- env/drone_pp.h:
  • Remove XY boundary action softening (revert helper that didn’t help and may fight control near walls).
  • Slow the early action ramp to curb early fly-offs: scale 0.5→1.0 over ~400k global steps (was 0.7→1.0 over 100k).
  • Raise PP2 spawn altitude (+1.0 m; z_min −GRID_Z+3.5) and lift z-floor termination to −GRID_Z+1.0 (+0.3 if gripping) to reduce floor resets.

Hypothesis & Expected Metrics
- OOB decreases (primary) and episode_length increases; first non-zero ho_pickup (>0.005) should appear; collisions remain ≈0.5%.

Interactions to Watch
- Gates/Rewards: no change; hover/descent thresholds unchanged.
- Physics: unchanged core constants (no soft walls, base drag 0.10, ang damp 0.20).
- Curriculum: unchanged (decay clamped to ~200k steps in env logic).

Next Steps
- If OOB remains >0.90 after this change, consider modestly lowering BASE_MAX_VEL or widening XY edge margins further, but avoid adding soft walls/centralizing forces.
