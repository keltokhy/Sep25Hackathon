Run 2025-09-21T175631Z — Iteration 1

Problem
- Primary: OOB ≈ 0.970 with very short episodes (≈32 steps). Perfect grip/delivery = 0.0. Collision_rate ≈ 0.036.
- Pattern: Far‑field drift under random early policy quickly reaches ±GRID XY limits or floor, terminating before pickup behaviors can stabilize.

Evidence
- trainer_summary.json: mean_reward≈0.70, episode_len≈32.46, SPS≈1.7M, epoch=85.
- UI snapshot: ho_pickup≈974, de_pickup≈945 (counts), attempt_grip≈0.008, attempt_drop≈0.000, oob≈0.97.

Root cause (behavioral_analysis)
- Max linear speed is 20 m/s. With dt=0.05, displacement caps at ~1 m/step. From typical spawns (~±5–8 m from center), random actions can reach ±GRID (±30 m) in ~30–40 steps → OOB terminates almost immediately.
- Spawn and hover/descent gates already tuned away from boundaries; physics “helpers” (soft walls, heavy drag) are not active.

Change (for next iteration)
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h: BASE_MAX_VEL 20.0f → 12.0f.
- Rationale: Halves per‑step displacement to ~0.6 m (max), reducing boundary fly‑offs without adding counter‑forces; preserves control authority and keeps dynamics simple.

Expected impact
- OOB ↓ significantly; episode_length ↑.
- ho_pickup/de_pickup ↔/↑ due to more time near box; attempt_grip may rise from ~0.008.
- Collisions remain ≈2–4%.

Outcome (this run)
- Baseline measured; patch applied for next run. No rerun this iteration (single‑run policy).

Next step
- Keep proposals `{}` (no hparam changes). If OOB stays >0.9 next run, consider modest raise of box/drop z (+0.5 m) or slightly stronger boundary proximity weight (≤0.20), staying within gentle shaping.
