- episode_return: 0.144 (Δ +0.106)
- epoch: 85; sps: ≈1.78M; agent_steps: ≈276M

Interpretation
- Hover and descent remain established but attempts → grips still do not convert (perfect_grip=0). to_drop/ho_drop activity indicates frequent carry/drop-phase transitions without “perfect” credit, consistent with k staying high during the run.
- OOB ticked up (+4.7pp) while collisions eased slightly. Score/return edged up but without task completion.

Root Cause Trace
- Curriculum schedule in drone_pp.h clamps decay to ~50M steps via max_decay; with per-env global_tick ≈180k by epoch 85, k stays near ~17.8 for the entire run. “Perfect” metrics require k≈1; therefore perfect_grip/deliv remain zero even when grips/carry likely occur under lenient gates.
- Because we resume the policy across iterations, but the env’s global_tick resets each run, the slow schedule never reaches the strict regime within a single run. This stalls measurable success.

Change (staged for next run)
- Revert curriculum clamp to ~200k-step decay so k reaches 1.0 within a single run: drone_pp.h — max_decay = (k_max − k_min) / 200000.0f (was / 50000000.0f). Keeps grip/drop acceptance floors intact.

Expected Impact
- k progresses to strict regime by the end of a run → perfect_grip and perfect_deliv can become non-zero if acceptance floors are sufficient. Attempt→grip conversion should appear in logs; OOB should not materially worsen; collisions stay ≤0.11.

Interactions to Watch
- Gates: With lower k, hover/drop hover windows tighten (k-scaled); floors preserve feasibility.
- Metrics: Verify attempt_grip↑ → perfect_grip>0 and to_drop/ho_drop remain healthy.
- Stability: Monitor OOB; if OOB jumps >0.90, reassess spawn margins and boundary penalty.

Next Config
