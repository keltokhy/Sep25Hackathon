Run 2025-09-21T053033Z — Diagnostic and Action

Problem observed (metrics):
- perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.008, de_pickup≈0.008 (too low)
- to_drop=0, ho_drop=0
- oob≈0.952 (episodes end OOB/floor), collision_rate≈0.005
- episode_length≈51 steps; SPS≈1.4M; epoch=85

Root cause (behavioral_analysis):
- diagnostic_grip: drone fails to reach stable hover → no descent → no grips.
- OOB remained extremely high after adding an early action governor and stronger soft-boundary/drag tweaks.
- Regression evidence: OOB rose from ~0.86 (pre-governor) to ~0.95 (post-governor) and stayed there across runs.

Change applied (environment, not hparams):
- Reverted the early action governor in PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h: pass raw actions to move_drone; remove k-based scaling.

Hypothesis and expected impact:
- Scaling actions to ≤0.25 at high k starved control authority, preventing stabilization and increasing OOB.
- Removing it should increase hover acquisition (ho/de_pickup↑), lengthen episodes, and enable first grip attempts without raising collisions.

Notes & references:
- Decision aligns with Notes.md “Header evolution” guidance: revert harmful additions before layering fixes.
- Keep env.grip_k_decay=0.02 (slower curriculum) from baseline config; no trainer hyperparameter changes.
