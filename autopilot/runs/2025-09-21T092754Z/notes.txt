Run ID: 2025-09-21T092754Z
Iteration: 4

Problem
- OOB high and rising within run (snapshots ~0.53 → 0.72 → 0.80 → 0.82).
- Collisions low (~2.7%), so boundary exits dominate terminations.
- First non‑zero grips and rare deliveries observed (progress), but carry/drop hindered by frequent OOB.

Key Metrics (final snapshots)
- oob ≈ 0.804–0.822; collision_rate ≈ 0.027–0.029
- perfect_grip ≈ 428–753; perfect_deliv ≈ 2.6–7.9
- to_pickup/ho_pickup/de_pickup ≫; to_drop ≈ 340–560; ho_drop ≈ 76–135
- trainer_summary: success_rate ≈ 2.60; mean_reward ≈ 22.94; episode_len ≈ 184.04; sps ≈ 1.96–2.0M

Root Cause
- Early/random thrust can still accelerate drones into XY boundaries before stabilizing near the box.
- High BASE_MAX_VEL (50 m/s) plus moderate spawn radius leaves room for far‑field drift; curriculum/gates help but don’t prevent runaways.

Change (for next run)
- dronelib.h: cap BASE_MAX_VEL 50 → 20 m/s to curb boundary fly‑offs without adding damping.
- drone_pp.h/reset_pp2: increase edge_margin 12 → 16 m for box/drop spawns; tighten lateral spawn radius r_xy 0.4–1.0 → 0.3–0.8.

Expected Impact
- OOB ↓ (primary); longer episodes; ho/de_pickup ↔/↑; to_drop/ho_drop ↑; collisions remain ≈2–3%.
- Grip/delivery signals preserved or improved due to fewer resets before carry/drop.

Resume/Artifacts Policy
- autopilot.resume_mode=fresh; save_strategy=best; next_config.json = {} (no hparam changes per policy).

Next Steps
- If OOB remains >0.7: consider slightly enlarging edge_margin again or capping BASE_MAX_OMEGA.
- If carry improves but deliveries remain sparse: re‑check drop hover/descent gates at k≈1 (tolerance vs carry jitter).
