Device: mps | Config: baseline_full (EXACT_CONFIG=1)

Problem observed (final User Stats):
- oob≈0.858; collision_rate≈0.005; episode_length≈147
- perfect_grip=0.0; perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.073; de_pickup≈0.073; to_drop=0.0; ho_drop=0.0
- Interpretation: diagnostic_grip with high OOB. Agents often descend while laterally misaligned, clip floor, and reset. Collisions remain low.

Change (env/drone_pp.h):
- Gate descent on XY alignment: only descend in pickup/drop when xy_dist <= 0.20·max(k,1); otherwise hold altitude and correct lateral error.
- Add near‑miss counters: env->log.attempt_grip / attempt_drop to instrument close attempts.
- Export new counters in binding (drone_pp/binding.c) for visibility.

Historical reference (Notes.md):
- Builds on prior steps: gentler descent (−0.06), relaxed grip gates (0.20·k), spawn near box, raised pickup hover (+0.9m), aligned drop hover (0.3–0.6m).
- Aligns with “Phase logic clarified” under Header Evolution; avoids re‑introducing low‑altitude penalties.

Expected outcome (next run):
- OOB decreases by avoiding drift‑descent and floor clipping.
- ho_pickup and de_pickup increase; first non‑zero gripping events register.
- Collisions remain low; deliveries may still be rare until gripping improves.
