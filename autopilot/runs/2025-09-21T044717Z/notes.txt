Run 2025-09-21T044717Z (iteration 2)

Problem
- diagnostic_grip: perfect_grip = 0, perfect_deliv = 0
- ho_pickup ≈ 0.003, de_pickup ≈ 0.003 (can’t reach hover)
- OOB extremely high ≈ 0.954; collision_rate ≈ 0.0048
- episode_length ≈ 49; SPS ≈ 1.39M

Change (for next iteration)
- Strengthened early action governor in env step to curb untrained saturation at high curriculum difficulty k.
  • PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h: scale = 1 − 0.05·(k−1), clamped to [0.25, 1.0]
    (previously 1 − 0.03·(k−1), floor 0.35).
- No hyperparameter changes; proposals set autopilot.resume_mode=fresh.

Rationale
- Despite spawn-near-box, gentler descent, relaxed hover/grip gates, soft boundaries, and increased damping, OOB remains ~0.95 and hover rarely registers.
- Notes > Decisions (2025-09-21T04:34Z) suggested an early action governor; this iteration strengthens it to further reduce early saturation.

Expected Impact
- OOB ↓; episode_length ↑; ho_pickup/de_pickup ↑; attempt_grip ↑.
- Collisions stable; first non-zero grips possible; to_drop remains 0 until grips appear.

Next
- If OOB remains >0.5 and ho/de_pickup stay ~0, consider increasing soft-boundary gains or motor lag (BASE_K_MOT) as an orthogonal physics lever before touching reward shaping again.
