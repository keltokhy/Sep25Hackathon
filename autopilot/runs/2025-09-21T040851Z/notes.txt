Problem (diagnostic_grip):
- perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.007, de_pickup≈0.007 (final window)
- to_drop=0.0, ho_drop=0.0
- oob≈0.863, collision_rate≈0.0054
- Signs of early improvement then degradation (ho_pickup≈0.16 early → ≈0.007): curriculum likely tightening (k decays) before policy stabilizes hover.

Change (env only; no hparam edits):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h
  • Relax pickup hover gates: dist_to_hidden<2.4 (↑) and speed<1.6 (↑); add fallback hover_ok_xy with xy≤0.75·k (↑), z>0.3 (↓), speed<2.5 (↑).
  • Spawn nearer to box: radial offset 0.5–1.2 (was 0.8–2.0); spawn z +1.5..2.5 (was +2.0..3.0).
  • Initial hover height: +0.6 over box (was +0.9) to reduce vertical transit before descent.

Expected impact:
- ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑ as hover acquisition becomes achievable; reduced travel distance lowers OOB.
- First credible grip attempts (attempt_grip↑) and potential first non-zero grips; collisions should remain low as descent remains XY-gated and gentle (−0.06 m/s).

Outcome (this run):
- Baseline metrics above; no code changes applied during this run by design (single-run policy).

Next:
- Launch next iteration with these env changes; monitor ho/de_pickup, attempt_grip, OOB, and check for first grips. If ho/de improve but grips remain 0, consider mildly relaxing grip vertical gate (vel.z > −max(0.15, 0.06·k)) or slowing k decay (curriculum control via env), per Notes header evolution.
