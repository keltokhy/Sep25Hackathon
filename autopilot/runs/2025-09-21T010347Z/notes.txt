Run 2025-09-21T010347Z — Analysis and Patch Plan

Problem
- Behavioral snapshot shows high OOB (~0.80), zero perfect_grip and zero deliveries.
- Hover/grip attempts are sparse; to_drop and ho_drop remain at 0.
- Likely cause: pickup phase starts too close to the floor (spawn z 1.5–2.5 m above box; hover target +0.6 m), leaving little headroom and causing floor-induced resets before stable hover/descent.

Change (Environment only)
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h:
  • Raise hidden pickup hover offset to +0.9 m (was +0.6 m).
  • Raise spawn altitude to 2.0–3.0 m above the box (was 1.5–2.5 m).
- Rebuilt native bindings (NO_TRAIN=1) and smoke-imported the binding successfully.

Expected Outcome / Hypothesis
- Reduce floor-proximity OOB during approach and descent; increase stable hover time (ho_pickup↑) and descent attempts (de_pickup↑).
- Grip still gated at the same thresholds; anticipate first non-zero grips if hover stabilizes; deliveries may remain limited until grips increase.
- Collision rate should remain low; SPS unaffected.

Historical Context
- Intentional deviation from the prior “lower hover offset (+0.6 m)” diagnostic patch after observing persistent high OOB. This aligns with the fix_stability path in Notes and does not reintroduce removed low-altitude penalties.
