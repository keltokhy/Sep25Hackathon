Problem observed (behavioral + metrics):
- Iteration 1 | Run 2025-09-21T050357Z (baseline_full, EXACT_CONFIG=1).
- Extreme OOB ≈ 0.953; collision_rate ≈ 0.005; episode_length ≈ 50.
- Funnel: to_pickup ≈ 3.1k; ho_pickup ≈ 0.01; de_pickup ≈ 0.01; perfect_grip = 0; to_drop = 0; ho_drop = 0; perfect_deliv = 0.
- Diagnosis: diagnostic_grip + fix_stability. Agents approach but rarely stabilize over the box; episodes end prematurely due to OOB/floor.

Change made (environment-only, no hparam changes):
- Physics stability in `PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h`:
  • BASE_B_DRAG 0.35 → 0.50 (more linear damping; less drift/overshoot).
  • BASE_K_ANG_DAMP 0.30 → 0.35 (more angular damping; steadier attitude).
  • Soft boundary forces: widen/strengthen to further reduce early OOB
    - wall_band 3.0, wall_k 18; floor_band 2.0, floor_k 20; ceil_band 2.0, ceil_k 12.
- Spawn stability in `PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h`:
  • Raise pickup spawn altitude to box_z + [2.0..3.0] (was +[1.5..2.5]) to avoid early floor strikes.

Historical context (Notes → Header evolution):
- Keeps hover→descent→grip gates as currently relaxed; does not re‑introduce low‑altitude penalties.
- Follows the “soft boundary fields” escalation path when OOB > 0.5 after initial soft walls.
- Avoids repeating the last change (action governor); choosing orthogonal dimension (physics/boundaries).

Expected outcome (next iteration):
- OOB ↓↓, episode_length ↑; ho_pickup & de_pickup ↑ (agents survive to hover/gate conditions).
- attempt_grip ↑ and first non‑zero grips possible; collision_rate stable.
- If OOB remains > 0.5: consider adding a gentle centralizing field toward arena center (keep thrust-dominant), else revisit descent/hover gates.

- autopilot/proposals/next_config.json = {} (no hyperparameter changes).
