Run 2025-09-21T070501Z — analysis and next action

Problem
- OOB dominant (~0.95). perfect_deliv = 0 despite non‑zero perfect_grip (~0.13–0.18).
- Carry phase partial: to_drop non‑zero (~1.9k), but ho_drop very low (26–36) and attempt_drop ≈0.003.
- Collisions low (~0.02). Episodes short (~53–77 steps). SPS high (~1.37M).

Observations (from UI panel)
- ho/de_pickup both strong (≈3.2k–3.3k), indicating approach + descent at pickup are working.
- After grip, agents head toward drop (to_drop > 0) but often terminate OOB before stabilizing at drop.
- Reward currently gates velocity_penalty by proximity to the target; far away, speed isn’t penalized, encouraging fast runaways.

Root cause hypothesis
- Far‑field acceleration is effectively unchecked (velocity penalty ≈ 0 when far). With high max_vel, agents overshoot and drift to boundaries → OOB. This suppresses ho_drop and any deliveries.

Change (for next run)
- Env: PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h → compute_reward: remove proximity_factor from velocity_penalty so speed is mildly penalized globally.
  Rationale: keep approach shaping via approach_reward but discourage high‑speed drift anywhere in the grid.

Expected impact
- Primary: OOB decreases (episodes end less often at bounds); episode_length modestly increases.
- Secondary: ho_drop and attempt_drop increase (more stable arrivals at drop), enabling first deliveries as k→1.
- Collisions remain ≈2%; perfect_grip stable or slightly up due to fewer OOB terminations during pickup.

Notes
- Physics helpers remain off (no soft walls/centralizing); BASE_B_DRAG=0.10, BASE_K_ANG_DAMP=0.20 per failsafe.
- Spawns are center‑biased (edge_margin=6.0), and pickup/drop z slightly raised to reduce floor strikes.

Next
- If OOB still > 0.9 after this change, consider a small boundary‑proximity penalty or lowering BASE_MAX_VEL modestly (e.g., 25→15) to further curb runaways, before revisiting physics.
