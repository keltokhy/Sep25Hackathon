Problem
- diagnostic_grip: perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- Extremely high OOB (~0.953) throughout; collisions low (~0.005)
- Hover acquisition weak: ho_pickup≈0.016, de_pickup≈0.015; to_drop=0, ho_drop=0

Recent context
- Prior headers added: gentler hover/descent, relaxed pickup gates, spawn-near-box, soft walls + centralizing field, early action governor (drone_pp.h/dronelib.h). Ho/de rose from ~0→~0.015 but OOB stayed ≈0.95 and grips remain zero.
- Notes “Header evolution: drone_pp.h” emphasized stabilizing hover before descent and avoiding re‑adding low‑altitude penalties.

Root cause (hypothesis)
- Curriculum too aggressive: grip_k decays from ~17.9→1.0 in ~200k ticks (grip_k_decay≈0.0905). Gates tighten and the action governor relaxes too quickly for the policy to learn stable hover/descent, leaving OOB resets to dominate.

Change
- Slow curriculum: env.grip_k_decay 0.0905 → 0.02 in baseline (autopilot/configs/baseline_full.json). No trainer hparams changed.

Expected impact
- More time at easier settings: larger XY/Z gates and stronger action scaling persist longer.
- OOB should decrease; ho_pickup/de_pickup should increase past ~0.02 toward ≥0.05; first non‑zero grips likely without raising collisions.

Next
- If ho/de remain <0.05, widen hover gate slightly; else, once grips>0, inspect to_drop/ho_drop to improve carry→drop.
