This extends the same principle to reward shaping to avoid pushing directly into the box during approach.\n\nExpected impact / hypothesis:\n- Stabilize above box sooner; raise ho_pickup and de_pickup.\n- Increase attempt_grip and enable first non‑zero grips.\n- Reduce OOB by preventing drift‑descent into the floor/walls.\n- Collisions should remain low (no change to lateral gates).\n\nNext overrides:\n- autopilot/proposals/next_config.json = {} (no hyperparameter changes).\n
