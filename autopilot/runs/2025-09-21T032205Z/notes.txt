Run 2025-09-21T032205Z — analysis and next-step

Problem observed (end snapshot):
- perfect_grip = 0.0, perfect_deliv = 0.0
- ho_pickup ≈ 0.107, de_pickup ≈ 0.107 (hover/descend occur)
- to_drop = 0.0, ho_drop = 0.0
- oob ≈ 0.861, collision_rate ≈ 0.0053
- trainer_summary: success_rate = 0.0, episode_length ≈ 143.64, epoch = 85, sps ≈ 1.69M

Diagnosis (Decision Framework):
- diagnostic_grip — de_pickup > 0 but perfect_grip = 0 ⇒ descending but cannot grip.
- Likely cause: descent XY gate (0.30·max(k,1)) holds altitude for 0.30 < xy ≤ 0.40 while grip gate allows xy ≤ 0.40; drone hovers/"descends" state without actual vertical motion, so z stays too high to satisfy grip.

Change (for next iteration):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h
  • Raise Phase‑2 pickup descent XY threshold from 0.30→0.40·max(k,1).
  • Mirror same change for drop descent (0.30→0.40·max(k,1)).
  • Keep gentle descent rate at −0.06 m/s; no other gate changes.

Behavioral hypothesis:
- Align descent XY gate with grip gate so vertical motion proceeds whenever a grip could plausibly succeed. Expect attempt_grip↑, first non‑zero grips, and `to_drop>0`; collisions stable; OOB should not worsen (hover/XY gating unchanged).

Notes:
- No hyperparameters changed (EXACT_CONFIG=1). Next config staged as {}.
