  "behavioral_analysis": "Hover and descent quality clearly improved (ho/de_pickup and to_drop up), while OOB and collisions trended slightly down. However, perfect_grip and perfect_deliv remain at 0 and grip attempts are essentially flat vs prior. Diagnosis: agent descends toward the box but fails acceptance checks, so carry never reliably starts. Root cause is overly strict pickup acceptance/\"perfect\" envelope under current k regime. Solution staged for next run: relax pickup floors (XY/Z/speed/|vz|) and slightly relax the strict perfect envelope to allow the first successful grips to register without physics helpers.",
