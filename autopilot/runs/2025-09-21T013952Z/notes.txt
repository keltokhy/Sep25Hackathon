Problem observed (behavioral + metrics):
- diagnostic_grip with high OOB; agents rarely satisfy pickup hover gate → almost no descent/grip attempts
- Final User Stats snapshot: oob ≈ 0.855; ho_pickup ≈ 0.002; de_pickup ≈ 0.002; perfect_grip = 0; perfect_deliv = 0; to_drop = 0; ho_drop = 0
- Collisions low (≈0.006); episode_length ≈ 150; SPS ≈ 1.57M

Change (for next iteration):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h
  • compute_observations: for PP2, compute generic “to target” deltas to hidden_pos (hover waypoint) instead of box/drop
  • pickup Phase 1 gate: relax to dist_to_hidden < 1.8 and speed < 1.2 (was 1.0 / 0.8)

Historical alignment (Notes → Header evolution):
- Upholds phase logic (hover above box → controlled descent) and avoids reintroducing low‑altitude penalties
- Extends prior gate relaxations; keeps XY‑alignment requirement and gentle descent (−0.06 m/s)

Expected outcome:
- ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑; attempt_grip↑; modest oob↓ by guiding toward hover position and avoiding drift‑descent
- First non‑zero gripping under k≈1 if alignment succeeds; collisions should remain low

Overrides for next run:
- autopilot/proposals/next_config.json = {}
