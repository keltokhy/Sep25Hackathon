Run 2025-09-21T180522Z

Problem
- OOB extremely high (≈0.969); episodes end ~33 steps on floor/XY exits.
- Hover/descent at pickup occur (ho_pickup≈1027, de_pickup≈998), but perfect_grip=0 and to_drop≈0.45 with ho_drop≈0.
- Attempt counts very low (attempt_grip≈0.010, attempt_drop≈0.000).

Diagnosis
- Primary failure: early floor strikes and boundary fly‑offs under random policy.
- PP2 gates allow hover/descent, but descent velocity plus low spawn height produce floor terminations before grip.
- Curriculum already clamped to global 200k‑step target; physics set to sane defaults (no soft walls, BASE_B_DRAG=0.10, BASE_K_ANG_DAMP=0.20).

Change (staged for next run)
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h:
  • reset_pp2: spawn at box_z+2.5–3.5 m (was +2.0–3.0 m).
  • reset_pp2: add tiny initial upward velocity dz≈+0.03–0.08 m/s to avoid immediate floor falls.
  • pickup/drop descent rate: −0.05 m/s (was −0.06) for gentler approach.
  • initial hidden hover raised to +0.9 m.

Expected Impact
- OOB↓ (primary); longer episodes (~40–60 steps initially).
- ho/de_pickup ↔/↑; attempt_grip↑; first non‑zero grips plausible.
- to_drop↑ as post‑grip carry stabilizes earlier; collisions ~3–4%.

Next Steps
- If OOB remains >0.90: consider slightly higher spawn (+0.5 m) or mild floor‑proximity penalty (avoid over‑shaping); do not add drag or soft walls.
- If descent occurs but grips still 0: further relax grip XY/Z/speed gates marginally while keeping z>0 constraint.
