Run: 2025-09-21T021614Z
Behavioral analysis: fix_stability + diagnostic_grip
- Symptoms: OOB resets ≈ 0.874; collisions ≈ 0.005; perfect_grip = 0.0; perfect_deliv = 0.0; to_drop = 0; ho_drop = 0; ho_pickup low → near-zero late.
- Interpretation: Episodes end out-of-bounds, often near XY boundaries before meaningful hover/descent. Grip attempts do not register.

Change (for next iteration): edge-aware spawn + narrower radius
- File: PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h: reset_pp2()
- What: Constrain box/drop XY spawns to be ≥ 3.0 m from walls; narrow drone spawn radius around box from 1.0–2.5 m to 0.8–2.0 m (still clamped within grid). Rebuild bindings.
- Rationale: Notes → fix_stability: reduce boundary-induced OOB; keep agents near feasible hover corridors so hover/grip gates can engage.

Expected impact (next run):
- OOB↓ significantly; ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑; first non-zero attempt_grip counts and early grips possible; collisions unchanged.

Outcome (this run summary):
- success_rate=0.0; mean_reward≈6.12; episode_length≈130.5; collision_rate≈0.005; SPS≈1.74M; agent_steps≈276.0M; epoch=85.
