Problem
- OOB extremely high (≈0.92–0.93). Collisions ~0.058. perfect_grip=0, perfect_deliv=0.
- User Stats (final snapshot):
  - oob≈0.925, collision_rate≈0.058, episode_return≈-0.69
  - ho_pickup≫0, de_pickup≫0 (descending), to_drop low, ho_drop≈0.56
- Regression vs 2025-09-21T095422Z (mean_reward≈28.27, success_rate≈6.22%).

Change (env/drone_pp.h)
- Tighten PP2 spawn band and add curriculum on XY bounds:
  - edge_margin now 22→14 over ~200k global steps (uses global_tick).
  - lateral spawn radius r_xy reduced 0.3–0.8 → 0.2–0.6 around box.
- Rationale: With OOB>0.90, focus on stability. Constrain early wandering without adding soft walls/centralizing fields. Expect longer episodes and more hover acquisition, enabling grip/drop work later.

Expected
- OOB ↓ materially; episode_length ↑; ho/de_pickup ↔/↑; collisions stable (~2–3%).
- Once OOB stabilizes, relax grip/drop gates if perfect_grip stays 0.

Next
- If OOB still >0.9: consider mild action governor for XY only or further tighten initial r_xy; do not add soft walls.
- If OOB improves but grips still 0: relax grip success gates (diagnostic_grip path).
