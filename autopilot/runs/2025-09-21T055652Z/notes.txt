Run 2025-09-21T055652Z — analysis and next steps

Problem
- improve_carrying: first non-zero grips observed previously, but deliveries remain 0.
- Drop-phase engagement is rare: ho_drop very low despite substantial to_drop while carrying.
- OOB still high (~0.95); collision rate acceptable (~2.1%).

Key metrics (final UI snapshot)
- perfect_grip ≈ 0.10; perfect_deliv = 0.00
- ho_pickup ≫ 0; de_pickup ≫ 0; attempt_grip ≈ 0.017
- to_drop large; ho_drop ≈ 37 (very low), attempt_drop ≈ 0.003
- oob ≈ 0.950; collision_rate ≈ 0.021; episode_length ≈ 52.8; SPS ≈ 1.44M

Root cause hypothesis
- Drop hover and descent gates remain too strict relative to pickup when carrying the box (more jitter, reduced control).
- The policy frequently approaches the drop zone (to_drop≫0) but fails to satisfy the drop hover XY gate; descent and delivery rarely trigger.

Change applied (for next run)
- Widen drop gates in `PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h`:
  • Hovering for drop: XY < 1.25·k (was 0.75·k), z > 0.3, speed < 2.5.
  • Drop descent start: XY ≤ 0.55·max(k,1) (was 0.40·max(k,1)).
  • Delivery success: XY < 0.35·max(k,1) (was 0.30·max(k,1)), z < 0.30·max(k,1).

Expected impact
- ho_drop↑ and attempt_drop↑ once grips occur; first non‑zero deliveries possible.
- OOB should not worsen; collisions expected to remain < 0.05.

Notes
- No trainer/env/vec hyperparameter changes in proposals; kept `{}` per policy.
- If ho_drop remains low next run, consider modestly widening hover to 1.5·k and/or slightly relaxing the delivery z gate (≤0.35·k). Keep curriculum (grip_k_decay=0.02) unchanged for now.
