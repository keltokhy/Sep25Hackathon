CRITICAL ANALYSIS - Run 2025-09-21T055652Z
==========================================

THE 95% OOB PROBLEM - ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
Despite fixing grip_k_decay and achieving first grips (0.12!), OOB remains at 95%!

EXCESSIVE PHYSICS MODIFICATIONS ARE THE PROBLEM:
- BASE_B_DRAG = 0.50 (was 0.1) - makes control extremely sluggish
- BASE_K_ANG_DAMP = 0.35 (was 0.2) - excessive angular damping
- Soft walls with aggressive constants (wall_k=18, floor_k=20, ceil_k=12)
- Centralizing field (center_k=0.08) fighting drone control
- Spawn raised to +2-3m above box (was +1.5-2.5m)

All these "fixes" are FIGHTING EACH OTHER and preventing the drone from flying properly!

THE GRID BOUNDARIES:
- X/Y: ±30m, Z: ±10m (defined in dronelib.h)
- Box spawns at (-26 to +26, -26 to +26, -9.5)
- Drone spawns 0.5-1.2m from box, +2-3m higher
- With sluggish physics, drone overshoots boundaries constantly

WHY THE AUTOPILOT KEEPS FAILING:
1. It adds band-aids instead of reverting harmful changes
2. Each "fix" compounds the problem (drag→soft walls→centralizing)
3. The physics modifications make control HARDER, not easier
4. With BASE_B_DRAG=0.50, the drone moves like it's in syrup!

THE SOLUTION:
1. REVERT physics to baseline (BASE_B_DRAG=0.1, BASE_K_ANG_DAMP=0.2)
2. REMOVE soft walls and centralizing fields
3. KEEP grip_k_decay=0.005 (this actually helped)
4. Let the drone learn to fly naturally without artificial constraints

EVIDENCE:
- Before physics mods: OOB ~0.85-0.86
- After physics mods: OOB ~0.95+ (WORSE!)
- The drone needs responsive control to stay in bounds, not syrup-like physics
