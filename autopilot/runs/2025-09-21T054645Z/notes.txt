Run 2025-09-21T054645Z — analysis and next steps

Problem
- diagnostic_grip improved to first non-zero grips, but deliveries still 0.
- OOB remains very high (~0.954). Collision rate acceptable (~2.2%).

Key metrics (final UI snapshot)
- perfect_grip ≈ 0.12; perfect_deliv = 0.00
- ho_pickup ≫ 0; de_pickup ≫ 0; attempt_grip ≈ 0.015
- to_drop large; ho_drop very low (~31), attempt_drop ~0.002–0.003
- oob ≈ 0.954; collision_rate ≈ 0.022; episode_length ≈ 48.9; SPS ≈ 1.37M

Root cause hypothesis
- Drop hover and delivery success gates are too strict relative to pickup gates.
- After enabling grips (slower grip_k decay), the policy reaches/descends to pickup but cannot satisfy narrow drop hover and success thresholds, preventing deliveries.

Change applied (for next run)
- Relaxed drop hover and delivery gates in `drone_pp.h` to mirror pickup tolerances:
  • Hovering for drop: XY < 0.75·k and z > 0.3 with speed < 2.5 (was XY < 0.4·k and 0.3–0.6m window).
  • Delivery success: XY < 0.30·k_floor and z < 0.30·k_floor (was 0.20·k for both).

Expected impact
- ho_drop↑ and attempt_drop↑ once grips occur; first non‑zero deliveries.
- OOB should not worsen; collisions stay < 0.05.

Notes
- No trainer/env/vec hparam changes. Proposal left as `{}` per policy.
