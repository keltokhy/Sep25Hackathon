Run 2025-09-21T073908Z — Iteration 2

Problem
- OOB remains high (≈0.865). Collisions acceptable (~0.023).
- Pickup phases engage (ho/de_pickup large), but carry→drop is weak: to_drop≈76–169, ho_drop≈15–45, attempt_drop≈0.001–0.003.
- Grips occur but are rare (perfect_grip≈85–198), deliveries barely register (perfect_deliv≈0.13–0.54).

Behavioral analysis (last 3 runs)
- 070501Z: oob≈0.95, perfect_grip≈0, deliveries 0 → baseline struggling to grip.
- 072610Z: oob≈0.79–0.81, first grips (≫0) and some deliveries (≈14) → big improvement.
- 073908Z: regression: oob↑ to ≈0.865, grips/deliveries down; ho/de_pickup still high.

Root cause hypothesis
- Carry-phase instability after grip: environment only applies box mass/inertia via update_gripping_physics() later (during drop hover when vz>0.3), not at the moment of gripping. The agent initially carries with base mass/drag, producing overshoot/drift, frequent OOB, and low to_drop/ho_drop.

Change (env/drone_pp.h)
- On grip success, call update_gripping_physics(agent) immediately when agent->gripping becomes true.

Expected impact
- Stability while carrying improves → OOB↓, to_drop↑, ho_drop↑, attempt_drop↑, perfect_deliv increases; collisions remain ~2–3%.

Notes
- No hyperparameter changes (EXACT_CONFIG=1 honored). Proposals left `{}`.
