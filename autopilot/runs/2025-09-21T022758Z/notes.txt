Profile: baseline_full.json (EXACT_CONFIG=1), device=mps

Behavioral analysis (from train.log user stats):
- perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.016–0.021; de_pickup≈0.015–0.021; to_drop=0.0; ho_drop=0.0
- oob≈0.87; collision_rate≈0.005; episode_length≈133–150; SPS≈1.7M

Failure mode: diagnostic_grip with high OOB. Agents approach but rarely satisfy the pickup hover gate; no grips observed, so no approach to drop.

Change (for next run):
- File: PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/drone_pp.h
- Phase‑1 pickup hover: add XY‑proximity fallback to acquire hover when `xy_dist <= 0.50·max(k,1)`, `z_above_box > 0.4m`, and `speed < 2.0m/s`. Descent remains XY‑gated (≤ 0.30·max(k,1)) and gentle (−0.06 m/s).

Historical alignment: Follows Notes “Header evolution” and hypotheses to relax early gates without re‑introducing low‑altitude penalties; keeps descent gating intact to avoid drift‑descent OOB.

Hypothesis / expected effect:
- Increase ho_pickup and de_pickup counts; register more `attempt_grip` and first non‑zero grips.
- Mild OOB reduction by avoiding prolonged hovering attempts near walls.
- Collisions should stay ~constant due to unchanged descent and drop gates.
