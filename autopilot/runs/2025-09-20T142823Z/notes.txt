Key metrics (trainer_summary.json)
- success_rate 0.000
- mean_reward 14.612
- episode_length 40.339
- collision_rate 5.98e-4 (low)

Utilisation (from train.log dashboard)
- CPU ~357% (well below host capacity); GPU(MPS) ~0%; DRAM ~32%; VRAM ~0%

Observations
- Policy quality: No successful episodes yet (rings_passed=0, perfect_deliv=0 in dashboard). Collision rate remains low, suggesting conservative behaviour and/or oob hovering (oob ≈ 0.962).
- Update signal: approx_kl ≈ 0.000 and clipfrac ≈ 0.0 across snapshots; value_loss ≈ 0.003; explained_variance ≈ 0.97. This indicates very small policy updates—likely dominated by tight clipping (clip_coef=0.12) and modest entropy (ent_coef=0.08).
- Throughput: SPS ~125k is consistent with vec 28/56 and batch 28,672. No instability observed.

Theory (why results look this way)
- With clip_coef set low (0.12), the surrogate objective is rarely clipped, and the effective step size is tiny (KL ~ 0). Combined with moderate entropy, the policy fails to explore sufficiently to discover sparse reward events (deliveries/rings), keeping success_rate at 0 while keeping collisions low.

Next run proposal (target: lift success probability while staying stable)
- Increase exploration and allow larger policy updates:
  - ent_coef: 0.08 → 0.10
  - clip_coef: 0.12 → 0.30
- Double training horizon for a single pass to give the policy time to realise the larger steps: total_timesteps 10M → 20M (~5 min at current SPS).
- Warm start from the latest checkpoint to retain any useful structure: resume_mode=continue, resume_from=latest, save_strategy=best.

What to watch next
- KL and clipfrac should move off ~0 (healthy range: small but non-zero); monitor success_rate, mean_reward, and collision_rate for meaningful movement.
- Keep vec/env topology unchanged (28/56, 4×8) to hold throughput constant; batch remains 28,672 with bptt 16.
