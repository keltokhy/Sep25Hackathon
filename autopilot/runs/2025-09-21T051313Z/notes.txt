Problem observed (behavioral_analysis via train.log):
- diagnostic_grip: perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0
- ho_pickup≈0.005–0.015; de_pickup≈0.005–0.015; to_drop=0; ho_drop=0
- oob≈0.953 (extremely high), collision_rate≈0.005, episode_length≈50

Root cause hypothesis:
- Drone rarely achieves hover over box; most episodes reset due to floor/XY OOB before gates can engage.
- Despite prior soft walls/floor and spawn-near-box, lateral drift remains high; hover gates can’t trigger before termination.

Change made (environment code only; no hparam edits):
- PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h: add a gentle centralizing field in compute_derivatives — a weak XY spring toward arena center (center_k=0.08), combined with existing soft boundaries. Vertical dynamics untouched.
- Rebuilt native bindings: `cd PufferLib && NO_TRAIN=1 python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace --force`.

Behavioral hypothesis and expected impact:
- Centralizing field curbs lateral drift early, reducing OOB resets and allowing agents to stabilize near the box.
- Expect OOB↓, ho_pickup↑ and de_pickup↑; collisions remain stable.
- With more stable hover/descents, first near‑miss grips should register (attempt_grip↑), unlocking conditions for first actual grips.

Metrics snapshot (final UI window):
- perfect_grip=0.0, perfect_deliv=0.0; ho_pickup≈0.005–0.015; de_pickup≈0.005–0.015; to_drop=0; ho_drop=0; oob≈0.953; collision_rate≈0.005; episode_len≈50; SPS≈1.7M.

Next step (for next iteration):
- Run once with the centralizing field (no proposal hparam changes). If OOB still >0.5 and ho/de_pickup remain <0.05, consider Priority‑1 `.ini` adjustments first (e.g., modestly widening pickup hover gate or slowing curriculum via grip_k_decay) before deeper physics.
