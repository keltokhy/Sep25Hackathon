Run 2025-09-21T061611Z (iteration 4)

Problem
- OOB ≈ 0.953 (primary issue). Collisions ≈ 0.022. perfect_grip ≈ 0.12; perfect_deliv = 0.00.
- ho/de_pickup are high, suggesting approach/hover phases occur, but environment physics likely fighting control near boundaries.

Root Cause Hypothesis
- Recent physics "helpers" increased damping and added soft walls + a centralizing field:
  • BASE_B_DRAG=0.50 (was ~0.10), BASE_K_ANG_DAMP=0.35 (was ~0.20).
  • Soft boundary and centralizing forces in dronelib.h.
- These interventions likely produce sluggish, contradictory dynamics that increase boundary interactions and prevent stable control, driving OOB up.

Change (for next run)
- Revert harmful physics helpers in PufferLib/pufferlib/ocean/drone_pp/dronelib.h:
  • BASE_B_DRAG 0.10 (from 0.50)
  • BASE_K_ANG_DAMP 0.20 (from 0.35)
  • Remove soft walls/ceil/floor and XY centralizing field (set F_soft/F_center to 0; stop adding these forces).

Expected Impact
- OOB ↓ materially (primary goal). Hover/descent stabilization should improve without fighting forces.
- Collision rate stays ~2.2% (no aggressive accelerations added).
- Attempt/ho/de_pickup remain healthy; grip/delivery gates unchanged, so delivery remains gated by grip success.
